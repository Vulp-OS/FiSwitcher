# Fi Switcher Readme

This project is an Android app that allows members of the Project Fi network to freely switch between networks without needing to memorize/paste dialer codes into Android's default dialer. 

## Background
 
We began pursuing this project after finding that virtually every implementation of an app that allows users to switch carriers requires either that you purchase the feature we were looking for, or that we paste content into the dialer rather than it doing it for us.
We decided to remedy this by creating Fi Switcher. The only ads included in the app are able to be opted out of.

## Install

Download it from the Play Store if you don't want to build it yourself. (Requires android 9.0 Pie or later)
Otherwise, feel free to clone the repository, add your own API keys where needed, and build it yourself with Android Studio!
